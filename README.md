# Advance-Now
Unlocks components from the "Advancements" mod.

<br>

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**

    This mod does NOT break the license specified and used by AureusStratus.

    The license from AureusStratus currently says: "Dont use my sprites without asking me first".

    This mod does NOT break that rule, because this mod contains NONE of those sprites.

    All the sprites belonging to AureusStratus live safely in their own mod, and only there.

<br>

**WARNING:**

This is effectively a cheat mod. This mod gives the player access to over-powered units and/or components. Don't use this mod, if you don't want the original game-play of the game spoiled for you!
